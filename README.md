## About MKPolygon-GPC

MKPolygon-GPC is an Objective-C Category that adds polygon boolean operators to the MKPolygon class.

## Installing
### CocoaPods
The easiest way to install MKPolygon-GPC is using CocoaPods:

1) Add the pod to podfile 
```
pod 'MKPolygon-GPC', '~> 0.0.1'
```

2) Refresh your project pods ```pod install```

### Manually
If you're not using cocoapods, just add `MKPolygon+GPC.h`, `MKPolygon+GPC.m`, `gpc.h` & `gpc.c` in your Xcode project.

## Usage

Usage is really simple. Just import the `MKPolygon+GPC.h` header file into your code.

```
#import "MKPolygon+GPC.h"

MKPolygon * firstPolygon = [code to create your 1st polygon];
MKPolygon * secondPolygon = [code to create your 2nd polygon];

// Create the union of two polygons.
MKPolygon * unionPolygon = [firstPolygon polygonFromUnionWithPolygon:secondPolygon];

// Create the difference between two polygons.
MKPolygon * differencePolygon = [firstPolygon polygonFromDifferenceWithPolygon:secondPolygon];

// Create the intersection between two polygons.
MKPolygon * intersectionPolygon = [firstPolygon polygonFromIntersectionWithPolygon:secondPolygon];

// Create the XOR between two polygons.
MKPolygon * exclusiveOrPolygon = [firstPolygon polygonFromExclusiveOrWithPolygon:secondPolygon];
```
